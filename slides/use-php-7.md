note:
    * In a scenario like this, the first thing you can do to help performance would be to make sure that the server your site is running on is using php7.
    * PHP 7 is about 3x faster than PHP 5.6
    * It has been out for a few years now
    * Most hosts offer it, if yours doesn't, get a different host.
