##  object caching - level 2

Leveraging object caching in your custom code.

```
function get_my_custom_data( $param ) {
    $cache_key = 'my_custom_data_' . $param;
    $custom_data = get_transient( $cache_key );
    if ( false === $custom_data ) {
        $custom_query = new WP_Query([...]);
        $custom_data = $custom_query->posts;
        set_transient( $cache_key, $custom_data, 'my_group', 5 * 60 );
    }
    return $custom_data;
}
```

note:

    Talk about transients
