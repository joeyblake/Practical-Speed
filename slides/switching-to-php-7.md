* [PHP Compatibility Checker Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/)
* [PHP Compatibility Checker CLI Tool](https://github.com/Alexia/php7mar)
* Use a test environment to evaluate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
    This should be evaluated to determine the how many adjustments will need to be made to leverage php 7, though in most cases, changes should be minimal. Which is why this should be the first thing to check.
